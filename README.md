I created this game to increase my proficiency in Windows PowerShell.<br/>
This really helped me learn:
* Functions
* Switches
* While Loops
* If statements
* Global Variables
* String Manipulation
* Progress Output

## To Play
Download "Buffet Bro.ps1" and right click > Run with PowerShell<br/>
Answer the prompts with letters upper or lower case.

* If it doesn't run you may have to change your Execution Policy
  * `Get-ExecutionPolicy -List` Will show your current policies.
  * `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted` Will allow you to run it.
  * If it still doesn't work you may have to use the `-scope` parameter with the appropriate scope.
